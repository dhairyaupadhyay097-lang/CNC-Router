## 10/30/2025 - #1 The Research  

#1

Guys, after few hours of surfing I just found out that CNC is about having few steppers motor for 3 axis movement and a drill or spindle for making extrusions and few motor driver for steppers, and umm yeah, a great structure with solid planning. well, I would like to tell you 

                           I AM MAKING THIS WITH NO EXPERIENCE FROM NOTHING

Don't worry, it doesn't mean if I don't know more about it then I cannot build this. "Set your heart ABLAZE". Well, my priority is targeting small objects as I have selected my build space of 300x250x150mm.

I surfed over the internet for the videos title 'Make your own DIY CNC' and got a basic idea of making it, then i lighted my brain and started off with some sketches of designt, as well as i found few things that i finalised for my CNC which are:

Spindle : https://robu.in/product/two-trees-500w-air-cooled-powerful-spindle-motor-kit-suitable-for-ttc-450/ 
Stepper motor : https://robu.in/product/nema17-40mm-1-2a-unipolar-stepper-motor-w-1m-cable/
Motor Driver : https://robu.in/product/tb6600-stepper-motor-driver-controller-4a-942v-ttl-16-micro-step-cnc-1-axis-upgraded-version-425786-stepper-motor/


For the sake of the processor and controlling I am thinking to build a custom PCB to fit my size and needs. I will be updating you Guys by the posts every day about electricals and structural things.

These are some yt referrals:

This is something I am expecting me to build.

STAY TUNED

  

## 11/6/2025 - #2 Starting off with the Baseplate   

#2

The baseplate!!, you may call it the start of the build or foundation for building whole CNC, I made rough sketch for planning the CNC. I made it like a rectangular box kind of thing with places for electrical box mixed. I have made round Rod like structure for attachment of side walls for top plate. IDK why i started this huge project but still, lets complete it.However, it is lot to develop yet, stay tuned!!
